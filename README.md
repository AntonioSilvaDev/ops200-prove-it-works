# Hey There :wave:

This project is our first look into creating tests for our app development.  It is based around TDD(Test Driven Development).  We had to create unit tests for both the Calculator and Mortgage Calculator as well as end-to-end(e2e) tests to make sure the complete application works as intended.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'npm run start' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.
